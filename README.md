# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

Hi, I'm Tom! I'm a Technical Support Specialist at Essex County College and an Information Technology student at NJIT, where I'm specializing in Managerial Information Systems while managing 200+ daily technical issues and maintaining critical IT infrastructure. I enjoy diving into network configurations, system troubleshooting, and learning new technologies, and when I'm not debugging or studying, you'll find me reading through my weekly book (anything from sci-fi to philosophy) or gaming with first-person shooters and fighting games. I'm excited to expand my development skills and connect with the GitHub community!
